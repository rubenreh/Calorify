**Calorify** is an innovative C++ project that integrates OpenCV for food object recognition, user input for personalized health metrics, and ChatGPT for determining food macros. This project is still in progress, and the following sections outline its functionality and future plans.

## Functionality

- **Food Object Recognition**: Use OpenCV to scan and recognize various foods. Currently, this functionality is being developed with a focus on identifying common foods such as chicken, beef, and fruits.

- **User Health Metrics Input**: Users can input their age, height, weight, and gender. This information will be used to calculate their daily caloric and macronutrient needs for various goals (e.g., maintain, lose, or gain weight).

- **Macro Calculation**: Integrate with ChatGPT to determine the nutritional content of the recognized foods. This feature will fetch data such as calories, protein, carbs, fats, and sugar for each food item.

- **Personalized Nutrition Plan**: Based on the userâ€™s input and scanned food items, Calorify will provide daily caloric and macronutrient recommendations tailored to the user's goals.

## Project Plan

1. **Basic Object Recognition**: Implement basic object recognition using OpenCV to identify common food items.
2. **User Interface for Input**: Develop a simple CLI for users to input their health metrics and food mass (if applicable).
3. **ChatGPT Integration**: Connect with the ChatGPT API to retrieve nutritional information for recognized foods.
4. **Macro Calculation Logic**: Create algorithms to calculate and recommend daily macros based on user input and goals.
5. **Testing & Optimization**: Test the application for accuracy in recognition and macro calculation, and optimize the codebase.
6. **Future Enhancements**: Consider expanding functionality to include more foods, enhance the user interface, and potentially introduce machine learning for more accurate food recognition.

## Current Status

The project is in its early development stages. The current focus is on building the core functionality, with a working prototype expected soon. Contributions and feedback are welcome as development progresses.
